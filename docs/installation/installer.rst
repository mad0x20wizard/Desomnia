Windows installer
=================

:OS: 🪟 *Windows*

The easiest way to setup Desomnia on Windows is to download the latest installer from it's `Release`_ page on GitHub, which allows you to set everything up and running in a minute.

It does the work for you, to register Desomnia as a system service, download and install all necessary dependencies and guide you through a basic configuration of the parameters. For your convenience, you can run the installer again (or hit “Modify” in the system settings) to add/remove some of the optional features later on.

Optional Features
-----------------

This installer includes all the available plugins from the main repository. You can install these plugins as needed, provided your system meets the necessary requirements:

* :doc:`/plugins/duo/plugin` – needs **Duo** to be installed
* :doc:`/plugins/hyperv` – needs the **Hyper-V-Platform** feature enabled
* :doc:`/plugins/fko`

Uninstallation
--------------

If it happens that you don’t like Desomnia, the uninstaller will help you to remove everything from your system completely. Just open the "Installed apps" in the system settings, search for "Desomnia" and hit "Uninstall".
